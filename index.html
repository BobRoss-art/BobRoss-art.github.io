    <h1>Bob Ross</h1>



    <p> He was the creator and host of "The Joy of Painting", 
	an instructional television program that aired from 1983 to 1994</p>
    
 
 <p>Ross went from being a public television personality in the 1980s and 1990s to being an Internet 
 celebrity in the 21st century, with his talent and kindness leading to major 
 popularity with fans on YouTube, Twitch, and many other websites 
 many years after his deat.During his 20-year tenure with the U.S. Air Force,
 Ross developed a taste for painting after attending an art class
 at the Anchorage U.S.O. club. He found himself frequently at odds with many of his
 painting instructors, who were more interested in abstract painting.
 In Ross's own words:
 "They'd tell you what makes a tree, but they wouldn't tell you how to paint a tree.
 Ross used the wet-on-wet oil painting technique, in which the painter 
 continues adding paint on top of still-wet paint rather than waiting
 a lengthy amount of time to allow each layer of paint to dry.
 From the beginning, the program kept the selection of tools and colors
 simple so that viewers would not have to make large investments in expensive equipment.
 Ross frequently recommended odorless paint thinner (aka odorless mineral spirits)
 for brush cleaning. 
 Combining the wet painting method with the use of large one- and two-inch brushes,
 as well as painting knives, allowed Ross to paint trees, clouds, mountains,
 and water in a matter of seconds.
 Each painting would start with simple strokes that appeared as nothing more
 than smudges of color. As he added more and more strokes, the blotches would transform
 into intricate landscapes.
